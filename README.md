Sublime Text 3 User Package
===========================

This is my user-specific configuration for Sublime Text 3. Most of the configuration is around additions to Vintage to make it more Vim-like.


Features
--------

1. `:s` invokes Replace panel
1. `Y` yanks to end of line, rather than the whole line. This annoyed me in Vim as well.
1. `:bd` closes current buffer
1. `:wq` saves current file and closes buffer
1. `:e` edits a file
1. `ZZ` saves and closes current file as a normal-mode command
